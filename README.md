LaTeX_templates
===============

Really simple LaTeX templates i usually use for different kind of reports. 

I know there is prettier tempaltes outhere. Nevermind, these are tempaltes I did quickly and wanted to save somewhere for further usage.
It is easy to use :
"LaTeX simplest report" : is the most simpler thing there is. Just a .tex for each chapter or section. No Bibtex.
"LaTeX important report" : same as previous but with  Bibtex.

If I have time, I'll update or add new templates
